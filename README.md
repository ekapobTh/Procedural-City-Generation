# Procedural City Generation

This repository is my research work in the area of Procedural Content Generation (PCG), utilized for generating cities in the Unity Engine.

## Version

This project is available on Unity Engine version 2022.3.10f1

## How to use?

* `Seed` - Controlling randomness.
* `Column` - Control the width of the city.
* `Row` - Control the depth of the city.
* `Final Scale` - Control the scale of each city in the city.
* `Lot Column` - Control the width of each lot in the city.
* `Lot Row` - Control the depth of the lot.
* `Maximum Lot Road Count` - Control the road amount on each lot. (won't generate further if no space left)
